🛸 **About Me**

Greetings, Earthling. I'm **Moneebb**, a 3rd-year CS student by day and a **Galactic Systems Architect** by night. Currently crafting tech relics from the future – like **TrackOrb**, the first AI-powered smart cricket ball designed to transcend time and technique. 📡🏏

🧬 I'm on a mission to blend biomechanics, AI, and Bluetooth into a new era of **augmented athleticism**.
